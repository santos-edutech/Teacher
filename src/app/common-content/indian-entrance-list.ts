The assignment of the second degree in B.E. for the M.Sc. students is announced generally at the completion of their first year courses. The allotment process to a particular B.E. stream, is purely on the basis of the academic performances of the students in the 1st year at BITS and the number of seats available in that particular programme. If a student is admitted to a second degree programme under dual degree scheme, he/she has to pay the admission fees of the second programme, separately, at the time of such admission is made. The curriculum for such dual degree students are designed in such a way, that the students will complete all the formalities required for both the degrees, normally in five years.',
