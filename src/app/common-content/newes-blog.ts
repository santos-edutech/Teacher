An example search on Expedia shows the cheapest route as $631.20 USD via TAP Portugal.'+'\n\n'+'Kiwi.com, on the other hand, will mix and match airlines (including budget airlines) in order to find you the very cheapest route.

For example, lets say your first flight with JetBlue was delayed, and you missed your connecting flight with Norwegian Air. Because the airlines have no association with each other, Norwegian Air has no obligation to reschedule your flight for free, so you would just lose your money. Kiwi.com instead offers their own guarantee, which covers schedule changes, flight delays, and cancellations. As long as you contact Kiwi.com as soon as you are aware of the delay, they will provide you with an alternate connecting flight, or a full refund, at your discretion.

However, the four most widely cited lists are published by Forbes, Niche, U.S. News & World Report, and the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education.'+'\n\n'+'Each set of rankings emphasizes different variables according to their primary focus, which naturally influences the order.

Fortunately, combining these different best colleges lists allows us to develop a strong overall sense of how Ivy League schools stack up against one another.'+'\n\n'+'It’s important to note that the scopes of rankings differ. For instance, U.S. News & World Report ranks Ivy League schools against other national universities (e.g., Stanford, MIT, UCLA, University of Virginia), but not liberal arts colleges (e.g., Amherst, Bowdoin, Middlebury), many of which are excellent, highly-regarded schools.

The more selective a school is, the more likely it is that your child will list it as their dream school.

On the other hand, if your child wants to pursue engineering or hotel management, Cornell might be the better fit for them.'+'\n\n'+'In addition, it’s important to consider each school’s setting when applying to Ivy League schools. Penn, for instance, might offer more immediate access to working with low-income communities than Princeton. Moreover, whether your child wants to attend school in an urban, suburban, or rural setting should influence their choice on where to apply. For example, do they want to live in a big city or be as close to nature as possible?'+'\n\n'+'Student body size is another meaningful variable for your child to think about. Most of the Ivy League schools enroll somewhere between 4,000 and 8,000 undergraduate students, while Cornell is an outlier, typically enrolling over 10,000 undergrads. Whether your child wants to be part of a relatively small or large student body might contribute to their overall happiness and social opportunities during college.'+'\n\n'+'Finally, campus culture varies from school to school.
