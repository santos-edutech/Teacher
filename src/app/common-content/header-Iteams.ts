Colleges and universities use SAT scores to make admission decisions into their bachelor programs. The SAT is a multiple-choice, pencil-and-paper test created and administered by the College Board. The purpose of the SAT is to measure a high school student’s readiness for college, and provide colleges with one common data point that can be used to compare all applicants. College admissions officers will review standardized test scores alongside your high school GPA, the classes you took in high school, letters of recommendation from teachers or mentors, extracurricular activities, admissions interviews, and personal essays. SAT scores are also accepted by good number of prestigious universities in India for Indian residents and foreign nationals and nonresident Indians.',

Because they receive public funding from their state they charge less to local ‘in-state’ students. ‘Out-of-state’ students pay more, regardless of whether they are a citizen of a different US state or a country outside the USA. There isn’t a higher fee specifically for international students. Private universities don’t receive any direct state funding (though they may benefit from federal research funds). This means more of their income is derived from student fees, making them higher than those at public universities.
