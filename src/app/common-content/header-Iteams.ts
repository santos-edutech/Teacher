Colleges and universities use SAT scores to make admission decisions into their bachelor programs. The SAT is a multiple-choice, pencil-and-paper test created and administered by the College Board. The purpose of the SAT is to measure a high school student’s readiness for college, and provide colleges with one common data point that can be used to compare all applicants. College admissions officers will review standardized test scores alongside your high school GPA, the classes you took in high school, letters of recommendation from teachers or mentors, extracurricular activities, admissions interviews, and personal essays. SAT scores are also accepted by good number of prestigious universities in India for Indian residents and foreign nationals and nonresident Indians.',
