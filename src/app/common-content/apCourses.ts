                'description':'Advanced Placement examinations (AP exams) are exams offered in the United States by the College Board and are taken each May by students. At many colleges and universities, a high enough score will earn the student college credit. In some instances, earning college credit can mean an overall lower college tuition fee. Learn more about why taking AP classes can be a smart choice. AP gives students the chance to tackle college-level work while they’re still in high school—whether they’re learning online or in the classroom. And through taking AP Exams, students can earn college credit and placement. Taking Advanced Placement tests show admissions officers that you’re ready for college-level work.'+'\n\n'+'Taking an AP training from EduTechEx is great prep for doing well in the corresponding AP test. Held every May, AP tests are scored on a scale from 1–5. If your college offers AP credit, a score of a 4 or higher could allow you to earn college credits without paying college tuition. Some students are able to skip the entire first year of college this way, thus cutting the entire cost of their college education by one quarter. AP classes can boost your GPA and strengthen your college application. But the number of advanced courses you choose to take should depend on your academic interests and your schedule.'+'\n\n'+'Recognized by universities around the world as a standard of academic excellence, the AP program is both flexible and modular so you can offer AP courses tailored to your school’s unique needs and other academic programs. Nearly all colleges and universities in the United States and Canada — as well as many institutions in UK, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Netherlands, France, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and more than 100 other countries — grant credit and placement for qualifying AP Exam scores. Most universities also acknowledge course participation, regardless of AP score, favorably in the admission process.'+'\n\n'+'There are currently 38 AP subject exams offered by college board. EduTechEx currently offers excellent online training for AP Biology, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Chemistry, AP Physics 1: Algebra-Based, AP Physics Algebra-Based, AP Physics C: Electricity & Magnetism, AP Physics C: Mechanics.',

                'description':'Advanced Placement examinations (AP exams) are exams offered in the United States by the College Board and are taken each May by students. At many colleges and universities, a high enough score will earn the student college credit. In some instances, earning college credit can mean an overall lower college tuition fee. Learn more about why taking AP classes can be a smart choice. AP gives students the chance to tackle college-level work while they’re still in high school—whether they’re learning online or in the classroom. And through taking AP Exams, students can earn college credit and placement. Taking Advanced Placement tests show admissions officers that you’re ready for college-level work.'+'\n\n'+'Taking an AP training from EduTechEx is great prep for doing well in the corresponding AP test. Held every May, AP tests are scored on a scale from 1–5. If your college offers AP credit, a score of a 4 or higher could allow you to earn college credits without paying college tuition. Some students are able to skip the entire first year of college this way, thus cutting the entire cost of their college education by one quarter. AP classes can boost your GPA and strengthen your college application. But the number of advanced courses you choose to take should depend on your academic interests and your schedule.'+'\n\n'+'Recognized by universities around the world as a standard of academic excellence, the AP program is both flexible and modular so you can offer AP courses tailored to your school’s unique needs and other academic programs. Nearly all colleges and universities in the United States and Canada — as well as many institutions in UK, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Netherlands, France, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and more than 100 other countries — grant credit and placement for qualifying AP Exam scores. Most universities also acknowledge course participation, regardless of AP score, favorably in the admission process.'+'\n\n'+'There are currently 38 AP subject exams offered by college board. EduTechEx currently offers excellent online training for AP Biology, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Chemistry, AP Physics 1: Algebra-Based, AP Physics Algebra-Based, AP Physics C: Electricity & Magnetism, AP Physics C: Mechanics.',
                'note':'The AP Calculus AB Exam will test your understanding of the mathematical concepts covered in the course units, as well as your ability to determine the proper formulas and procedures to use to solve problems and communicate your work with the correct notations. A graphing calculator is permitted for parts of the exam. Note: You may not take both AP Calculus AB and Calculus BC Exams within the same year.'+'\n\n'+'Exam Duration'+'\n\n'+'3Hrs 15Mins',

At many colleges and universities, a high enough score will earn the student college credit. In some instances, earning college credit can mean an overall lower college tuition fee. Learn more about why taking AP classes can be a smart choice. AP gives students the chance to tackle college-level work while they’re still in high school—whether they’re learning online or in the classroom. And through taking AP Exams, students can earn college credit and placement. Taking Advanced Placement tests show admissions officers that you’re ready for college-level work.'+'\n\n'+'Taking an AP training from EduTechEx is great prep for doing well in the corresponding AP test. Held every May, AP tests are scored on a scale from 1–5. If your college offers AP credit, a score of a 4 or higher could allow you to earn college credits without paying college tuition. Some students are able to skip the entire first year of college this way, thus cutting the entire cost of their college education by one quarter. AP classes can boost your GPA and strengthen your college application. But the number of advanced courses you choose to take should depend on your academic interests and your schedule.'+'\n\n'+'Recognized by universities around the world as a standard of academic excellence, the AP program is both flexible and modular so you can offer AP courses tailored to your school’s unique needs and other academic programs. Nearly all colleges and universities in the United States and Canada — as well as many institutions in UK, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Netherlands, France, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and more than 100 other countries — grant credit and placement for qualifying AP Exam scores. Most universities also acknowledge course participation, regardless of AP score, favorably in the admission process.'+'\n\n'+'There are currently 38 AP subject exams offered by college board. EduTechEx currently offers excellent online training for AP Biology, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Chemistry, AP Physics 1: Algebra-Based, AP Physics Algebra-Based, AP Physics C: Electricity & Magnetism, AP Physics C: Mechanics.',

AP gives students the chance to tackle college-level work while they’re still in high school—whether they’re learning online or in the classroom. And through taking AP Exams, students can earn college credit and placement. Taking Advanced Placement tests show admissions officers that you’re ready for college-level work.'+'\n\n'+'Taking an AP training from EduTechEx is great prep for doing well in the corresponding AP test. Held every May, AP tests are scored on a scale from 1–5. If your college offers AP credit, a score of a 4 or higher could allow you to earn college credits without paying college tuition. Some students are able to skip the entire first year of college this way, thus cutting the entire cost of their college education by one quarter. AP classes can boost your GPA and strengthen your college application. But the number of advanced courses you choose to take should depend on your academic interests and your schedule.'+'\n\n'+'Recognized by universities around the world as a standard of academic excellence, the AP program is both flexible and modular so you can offer AP courses tailored to your school’s unique needs and other academic programs.

At many colleges and universities, a high enough score will earn the student college credit. In some instances, earning college credit can mean an overall lower college tuition fee. Learn more about why taking AP classes can be a smart choice. AP gives students the chance to tackle college-level work while they’re still in high school—whether they’re learning online or in the classroom. And through taking AP Exams, students can earn college credit and placement. Taking Advanced Placement tests show admissions officers that you’re ready for college-level work.'+'\n\n'+'Taking an AP training from EduTechEx is great prep for doing well in the corresponding AP test. Held every May, AP tests are scored on a scale from 1–5. If your college offers AP credit, a score of a 4 or higher could allow you to earn college credits without paying college tuition. Some students are able to skip the entire first year of college this way, thus cutting the entire cost of their college education by one quarter. AP classes can boost your GPA and strengthen your college application. But the number of advanced courses you choose to take should depend on your academic interests and your schedule.'+'\n\n'+'Recognized by universities around the world as a standard of academic excellence, the AP program is both flexible and modular so you can offer AP courses tailored to your school’s unique needs and other academic programs. Nearly all colleges and universities in the United States and Canada — as well as many institutions in UK, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Netherlands, France, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and more than 100 other countries — grant credit and placement for qualifying AP Exam scores. Most universities also acknowledge course participation, regardless of AP score, favorably in the admission process.'+'\n\n'+'There are currently 38 AP subject exams offered by college board.

At many colleges and universities, a high enough score will earn the student college credit. In some instances, earning college credit can mean an overall lower college tuition fee. Learn more about why taking AP classes can be a smart choice. AP gives students the chance to tackle college-level work while they’re still in high school—whether they’re learning online or in the classroom. And through taking AP Exams, students can earn college credit and placement. Taking Advanced Placement tests show admissions officers that you’re ready for college-level work.'+'\n\n'+'Taking an AP training from EduTechEx is great prep for doing well in the corresponding AP test. Held every May, AP tests are scored on a scale from 1–5. If your college offers AP credit, a score of a 4 or higher could allow you to earn college credits without paying college tuition. Some students are able to skip the entire first year of college this way, thus cutting the entire cost of their college education by one quarter. AP classes can boost your GPA and strengthen your college application. But the number of advanced courses you choose to take should depend on your academic interests and your schedule.'+'\n\n'+'Recognized by universities around the world as a standard of academic excellence, the AP program is both flexible and modular so you can offer AP courses tailored to your school’s unique needs and other academic programs. Nearly all colleges and universities in the United States and Canada — as well as many institutions in UK, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Netherlands, France, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and more than 100 other countries — grant credit and placement for qualifying AP Exam scores. Most universities also acknowledge course participation, regardless of AP score, favorably in the admission process.'+'\n\n'+'There are currently 38 AP subject exams offered by college board. EduTechEx currently offers excellent online training for AP Biology, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Chemistry, AP Physics 1: Algebra-Based, AP Physics Algebra-Based, AP Physics C: Electricity & Magnetism, AP Physics C: Mechanics.',

At many colleges and universities, a high enough score will earn the student college credit. In some instances, earning college credit can mean an overall lower college tuition fee. Learn more about why taking AP classes can be a smart choice. AP gives students the chance to tackle college-level work while they’re still in high school—whether they’re learning online or in the classroom. And through taking AP Exams, students can earn college credit and placement. Taking Advanced Placement tests show admissions officers that you’re ready for college-level work.'+'\n\n'+'Taking an AP training from EduTechEx is great prep for doing well in the corresponding AP test. Held every May, AP tests are scored on a scale from 1–5. If your college offers AP credit, a score of a 4 or higher could allow you to earn college credits without paying college tuition. Some students are able to skip the entire first year of college this way, thus cutting the entire cost of their college education by one quarter. AP classes can boost your GPA and strengthen your college application. But the number of advanced courses you choose to take should depend on your academic interests and your schedule.'+'\n\n'+'Recognized by universities around the world as a standard of academic excellence, the AP program is both flexible and modular so you can offer AP courses tailored to your school’s unique needs and other academic programs. Nearly all colleges and universities in the United States and Canada — as well as many institutions in UK, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Netherlands, France, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and more than 100 other countries — grant credit and placement for qualifying AP Exam scores. Most universities also acknowledge course participation, regardless of AP score, favorably in the admission process.'+'\n\n'+'There are currently 38 AP subject exams offered by college board.

At many colleges and universities, a high enough score will earn the student college credit. In some instances, earning college credit can mean an overall lower college tuition fee. Learn more about why taking AP classes can be a smart choice. AP gives students the chance to tackle college-level work while they’re still in high school—whether they’re learning online or in the classroom. And through taking AP Exams, students can earn college credit and placement. Taking Advanced Placement tests show admissions officers that you’re ready for college-level work.'+'\n\n'+'Taking an AP training from EduTechEx is great prep for doing well in the corresponding AP test. Held every May, AP tests are scored on a scale from 1–5. If your college offers AP credit, a score of a 4 or higher could allow you to earn college credits without paying college tuition. Some students are able to skip the entire first year of college this way, thus cutting the entire cost of their college education by one quarter. AP classes can boost your GPA and strengthen your college application. But the number of advanced courses you choose to take should depend on your academic interests and your schedule.'+'\n\n'+'Recognized by universities around the world as a standard of academic excellence, the AP program is both flexible and modular so you can offer AP courses tailored to your school’s unique needs and other academic programs. Nearly all colleges and universities in the United States and Canada — as well as many institutions in UK, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Netherlands, France, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and more than 100 other countries — grant credit and placement for qualifying AP Exam scores. Most universities also acknowledge course participation, regardless of AP score, favorably in the admission process.'+'\n\n'+'There are currently 38 AP subject exams offered by college board.
